## General Design Notes for the Page:

*   **Clarity & Readability:** Prioritize clear communication. Use the defined typography (Montserrat for headings, Open Sans for body) with appropriate sizes and weights. Ensure strong contrast between text and background colors.
*   **Whitespace:** Incorporate generous whitespace around all elements and sections to create a clean, uncluttered, and professional look. This aids readability and focus.
*   **Color Palette:** Adhere strictly to the `visual_design_concept_proposal.md`. Primary colors (`#0A2A4E`, `#1A3A5A`) for foundational elements and text. Accent color (`#00C9B8`) for CTAs and highlights. Muted accent (`#E88D39`) used sparingly for warmth. Neutrals (`#F0F2F5`, `#FCFCFC`, `#333333`, `#555555`) for backgrounds and text.
*   **Messaging & Tone:** All content must align with `messaging_and_tone_guidelines.md` â professional, expert, trustworthy, innovative, aspirational, and honest.
*   **Visual Elements:**
    *   **Icons:** Use clean, modern line icons (SVG preferred). Style them consistently with the accent colors or primary blues.
    *   **Imagery:** If stock photos or abstract images are used, they must be high-quality, professional, and thematically relevant to AI, technology, community, or efficiency. Avoid clichÃ©s.
    *   **Cards:** Consistent styling for cards (rounded corners, subtle shadows, padding) as per the visual concept.
*   **Animations:** Implement subtle animations as proposed:
    *   Fade-ins on scroll for sections or elements.
    *   Hover effects for buttons, links, and cards (e.g., slight lift, color change).
    *   Ensure animations are smooth, quick, and do not hinder performance or accessibility.
*   **Responsiveness:** The page must be fully responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across all devices (desktops, tablets, mobiles). This includes adapting layout, font sizes, and navigation.
*   **Consistency:** Maintain consistency in design language (spacing, alignment, button styles, etc.) throughout the page.The landing page specification document has been created as `landing_page_specification.md`. It details the structure, content, and design for each section of the new landing page, incorporating elements from both `messaging_and_tone_guidelines.md` and `visual_design_concept_proposal.md`.

The specification covers:
1.  Global Elements (Header, Footer)
2.  Hero Section
3.  "Who We Are & What We Do" / Introduction Section
4.  "Our Focus Areas" / "Problem We Solve" Section
5.  "Our Approach" / "How We Innovate" Section
6.  "Featured Insights" / "Glimpse into Our Work" Section
7.  Call to Action (Footer CTA)
8.  General Design Notes for the Page

I believe this fulfills the subtask requirements.
