                <h2>Do I need a large amount of data to use AI?</h2>
                <p>While having more data typically improves AI performance, we can work with various data scenarios. For organizations with limited data, we can employ techniques like transfer learning, data augmentation, or synthetic data generation to build effective solutions.</p>

                <h2>How long does it take to implement an AI solution?</h2>
                <p>Implementation timelines vary based on project complexity and scope. Simple projects might take a few weeks, while more complex enterprise-wide systems could take several months. We follow an agile approach, often delivering value in incremental phases rather than waiting for complete implementation.</p>
